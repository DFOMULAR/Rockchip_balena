                jenkins_generate_ami.sh: Use a shared directory for preloaded
                image
              hash: 9b032f2fddc970db13147b4e637abd1bada1f234

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto
                cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache
                to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have
                its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when
                two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants
                during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the
                same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should
                fix the issue.

                `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it
                relies

                being

                source.

                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in
                whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and
                Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in
                the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more
                conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the
                kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of
                application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally
                unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max
                number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but
                without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as
                RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have
                chosen.

                There is at least a case in a board where the puts function in
                u-boot's

                common/console.c is #ifdef'ed and defined twice. Let's
                accomodate for

                such cases by correctly looping through more than one function

                definition if present.

                introduced when images including
                8227a61f6bef6d93cc6a5acd0ef93a2012079964

                made it to production.

                We can now use a runtime drop-in unit placed under /run/systemd/
                to

                configure the balena-host service, which doesn't require us to
                remount

                the rootfs.
